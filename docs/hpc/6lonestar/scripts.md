## [Sample Job Scripts](#scripts) { #scripts }

Copy and customize the following scripts to specify and refine your job's requirements.

* specify the maximum run time with the `-t` option. 
* specify number of nodes needed with the `-N` option
* specify total number of MPI tasks with the `-n` option
* specify the project to be charged with the `-A` option.

In general, the fewer resources (nodes) you specify in your batch script, the less time your job will wait in the queue. See [5. Job Submissions Tips](../../basics/conduct#conduct-jobs) in the [Good Conduct](../../basics/conduct) document. 

Consult [Table 6](../stampede3#table6) in the [Stampede3 User Guide](../stampede3) for a listing of common Slurm `#SBATCH` options.

Click on a tab header below to display it's job script, then copy and customize to suit your own application.

/// tab | Serial Jobs
Serial Jobs

Serial codes should request 1 node (`#SBATCH -N 1`) with 1 task (`#SBATCH -n 1`). 
  
!!! important 
	Run all serial jobs in the `normal` queue.

Consult the <a href="../../tutorials/launcher">Launcher at TACC</a> documentation to run multiple serial executables at one time.
