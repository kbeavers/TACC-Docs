## Launching Applications { #launching }

The primary purpose of your job script is to launch your research application. How you do so depends on several factors, especially (1) the type of application (e.g. MPI, OpenMP, serial), and (2) what you're trying to accomplish (e.g. launch a single instance, complete several steps in a workflow, run several applications simultaneously within the same job). While there are many possibilities, your own job script will probably include a launch line that is a variation of one of the examples described in this section:

Note that the following examples demonstrate launching within a Slurm job script or an `idev` session.  Do not launch jobs on the login nodes.

### One Serial Application { #launching-serial }

To launch a serial application, simply call the executable. Specify the path to the executable in either the `$PATH` environment variable or in the call to the executable itself:

``` job-script
myprogram                      # executable in a directory listed in $PATH
$WORK/apps/myprov/myprogram    # explicit full path to executable
./myprogram                    # executable in current directory
./myprogram -m -k 6 input1     # executable with notional input options
```

### One Multi-Threaded Application { #launching-multithreaded }

Launch a threaded application the same way. Be sure to specify the number of threads. Note that the default OpenMP thread count is 1.

``` job-script
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=144     # 144 total OpenMP threads (1 per GG core)
./myprogram
```


### One MPI Application { #launching-mpi }

To launch an MPI application, use the TACC-specific MPI launcher `ibrun`, which is a Vista-aware replacement for generic MPI launchers like `mpirun` and `mpiexec`. In most cases the only arguments you need are the name of your executable followed by any arguments your executable needs. When you call `ibrun` without other arguments, your Slurm `#SBATCH` directives will determine the number of ranks (MPI tasks) and number of nodes on which your program runs.

``` job-script
#SBATCH -N 4
#SBATCH -n 576
ibrun ./myprogram              # ibrun uses the $SBATCH directives to properly allocate nodes and tasks
```
To use `ibrun` interactively, say within an `idev` session, you can specify:

``` cmd-line
login1$ idev -N 2 -n 80 -p gg
c123-456$ ibrun ./myprogram    # ibrun uses idev's arguments to properly allocate nodes and tasks
```

### One Hybrid (MPI+Threads) Application { #launching-hybrid }

When launching a single application you generally don't need to worry about affinity: both OpenMPI and MVAPICH2 will distribute and pin tasks and threads in a sensible way.

``` job-script
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=8    # 8 OpenMP threads per MPI rank
ibrun ./myprogram           # use ibrun instead of mpirun or mpiexec
```
As a practical guideline, the product of `$OMP_NUM_THREADS` and the maximum number of MPI processes per node should not be greater than total number of cores available per node (GG nodes have 144 cores, GH nodes have 72 cores).

### MPI Applications - Consecutive { launching-mpi-consecutive }

To run one MPI application after another (or any sequence of commands one at a time), simply list them in your job script in the order in which you'd like them to execute. When one application/command completes, the next one will begin.

```job-script
module load git
module list
./preprocess.sh
ibrun ./myprogram input1    # runs after preprocess.sh completes
ibrun ./myprogram input2    # runs after previous MPI app completes
```

### MPI Application - Concurrent { launching-mpi-concurrent }

*Coming soon.*


### More than One OpenMP Application Running Concurrently { #launching-openmp }

You can also run more than one OpenMP application simultaneously on a single node, but you will need to distribute and pin tasks appropriately. In the example below, numactl -C specifies virtual CPUs (hardware threads). According to the numbering scheme for GG cores, CPU () numbers 0-143 are spread across the 144 cores, 1 thread per core.

``` job-script
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=2
numactl -C 0-1 ./myprogram inputfile1 &  # HW threads (hence cores) 0-1. Note ampersand.
numactl -C 2-3 ./myprogram inputfile2 &  # HW threads (hence cores) 2-3. Note ampersand.

wait
```

### Interactive Sessions { #launching-interactive }

#### Interactive Sessions with `idev` and `srun` { #launching-interactive-idev }

TACC's own `idev` utility is the best way to begin an interactive session on one or more compute nodes. To launch a thirty-minute session on a single node in the development queue, simply execute:

``` cmd-line
login1$ idev
```

You'll then see output that includes the following excerpts:
```cmd-line
...
-----------------------------------------------------------------
      Welcome to the Vista Supercomputer          
-----------------------------------------------------------------
...

-> After your `idev` job begins to run, a command prompt will appear,
-> and you can begin your interactive development session. 
-> We will report the job status every 4 seconds: (PD=pending, R=running).

->job status:  PD
->job status:  PD
...
c449-001$
```

The job status messages indicate that your interactive session is waiting in the queue. When your session begins, you'll see a command prompt on a compute node (in this case, the node with hostname c449-001). If this is the first time you launch `idev`, the prompts may invite you to choose a default project and a default number of tasks per node for future `idev` sessions.

For command line options and other information, execute `idev --help`. It's easy to tailor your submission request (e.g. shorter or longer duration) using Slurm-like syntax:

``` cmd-line
login1$ idev -p gg -N 2 -n 8 -m 150 # gg queue, 2 nodes, 8 total tasks, 150 minutes
```

For more information [see the `idev` documentation][TACCIDEV].

#### Interactive Sessions using `ssh` { #launching-interactive-ssh }

If you have a batch job or interactive session running on a compute node, you "own the node": you can connect via ssh to open a new interactive session on that node. This is an especially convenient way to monitor your applications' progress. One particularly helpful example: login to a compute node that you own, execute top, then press the "1" key to see a display that allows you to monitor thread ("CPU") and memory use.

There are many ways to determine the nodes on which you are running a job, including feedback messages following your sbatch submission, the compute node command prompt in an `idev` session, and the `squeue` or `showq` utilities. The sequence of identifying your compute node then connecting to it would look like this:

``` cmd-line
login1$ squeue -u bjones
 JOBID       PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
858811     skx-dev     idv46796   bjones  R       0:39      1 c448-004
1ogin1$ ssh c448-004
...
C448-004$
```
### Slurm Environment Variables { #launching-slurmenvs }

Be sure to distinguish between internal Slurm replacement symbols (e.g. `%j` described above) and Linux environment variables defined by Slurm (e.g. `SLURM_JOBID`). Execute `env | grep SLURM` from within your job script to see the full list of Slurm environment variables and their values. You can use Slurm replacement symbols like `%j` only to construct a Slurm filename pattern; they are not meaningful to your Linux shell. Conversely, you can use Slurm environment variables in the shell portion of your job script but not in an `#SBATCH` directive.

!!! warning 
	For example, the following directive will not work the way you might think:
	``` job-script
	#SBATCH -o myMPI.o${SLURM_JOB_ID}   # incorrect
	```
!!! tip 
	Instead, use the following directive:
	``` job-script
	#SBATCH -o myMPI.o%j     # "%j" expands to your job's numerical job ID
	```

Similarly, you cannot use paths like `$WORK` or `$SCRATCH` in an `#SBATCH` directive.

For more information on this and other matters related to Slurm job submission, see the [Slurm online documentation](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html); the man pages for both Slurm itself (`man slurm`) and its individual commands (e.g. `man sbatch`); as well as numerous other online resources.
