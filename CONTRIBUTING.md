# Contributing to TACC Technical Documentation

All contributions should be made via a GitHub pull request.  The pull requests will be reviewed by TACC's User Services staff, and if approved, incorporated into our documentation.

## Step by Step

1. [Fork][fork] this repository.
2. [Edit][edit] relevant files that need update.  [Upload images](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/adding-a-file-to-a-repository) as necessary.
3. [Commit][commit] your changes, writing [clear commit messages](#writing-commit-messages).
4. [Test][test] your changes if comfortable using a command prompt.
5. [Request][request] a review. This creates a "Pull Request".

## Style Guide

* Use [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) for your source text.
* Use `cwd`-relative paths to images e.g. instead of `/hpc/imgs/myimage.png`, use `../imgs/myimage.png` so that images load on the website **and** in GitHub preview.
* Some [Python-Markdown extensions](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/) and [PyMdown exensions](https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/#extensions) are enabled.  See enabled extensions at [`mkdocs.base.yml`](https://github.com/TACC/TACC-Docs/blob/main/mkdocs.base.yml) under `markdown_extensions:`.

### Writing Commit Messages

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small/typo changes, but more involved edits should include:

> **A brief summary of the commit**
> A not-so-brief description of what changed and its impact.
